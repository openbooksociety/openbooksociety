Data Processing within the Scope of Our Association's Activities  
\
Member Administration  
\
Member data (name, address, email address) are processed by the respective officers of our association only for the performance of their assigned tasks. In detail, this means:  
\
- When the board requires member data to fulfill its tasks, they are allowed to access all necessary member data. This includes, in particular, member administration.  
- The treasurer processes member data required for collecting membership fees, and the auditor processes member data relevant to financial audits. This includes first name, last name, postal address, and bank details with payment information, as well as, if applicable, access to the direct debit authorization including signature, provided the member has granted a direct debit mandate to the association.  
\
The purpose of processing member data is the pursuit and administration of the association's purpose. The legal basis is the association membership (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).  
\
The current member data is stored for the duration of the membership and beyond, without limitation.  
\
